create folder named monitoring demo where want to setup 
prometheus, grafana for Python App

inside this folder set up
app.py (for python code and prometheus-metrics)
Dockerfile to create image of app
prometheus.yml to configure targets in prometheus
requirements.txt to set up dependencies
docker-compose.yml to set up 3 services

To run the same:
    docker-compose up -d --build
check result
    docker ps 
3 services running now
    localhost:9090 prometheus dashboard
    localhost:3000 grafana dashboard
    localhost:5000 python app

localhost:9090/targets (you can see the services ups or not)
localhost:5000/ - trigger to send req to your web app
localhost:5000/metrics (see prometheus metrics)

refresh multiple times: localhost:5000 to send req

in prometheus query: http_requests_total -- Execute
(below you can see the results)

to send contiue req per second:
while true; do curl -s http://localhost:5000> /dev/null; sleep 1; done
(run in terminal)

you can see the results in prometheus
