Remote Backend

by default when we are working with Terraform it uses local backend.
It creates terraform.tfstate file which is stored locally.

for managing remote backend we can create one resource like s3 bucket and 
we can use tfstate file from bucket rather than using local one.

If want to create backend manually then create one folder named project
	modules
		remote-backend
			main.tf
			variables.tf
			outputs.tf
	main.tf
	outputs.tf
	variables.tf

save all files and then execute below commands.

terraform init

terraform validate

terraform apply --auto-approve

once its completed you can take the bucket name created and then create one file named backend.tf

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "sonam-bucket-927fec3e" #replace with your bucket name
    key = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

save file and then execute below command.

terraform init 
confirm yes for remote backend and then your tfstate files maintaind by remote backend.

******************************************************************************************

In case if you don't want to run above mentioned command one by one then you can run shell scripting to execute all things 
step by step.

there is already run.sh file available in the code that executes all commands one by one take the bucket name from output raw 
and then its creating backend.tf automatically and  then init shift local backend to remote backend.
