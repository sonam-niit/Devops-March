Workspace: helping usto isolate state evironment within the same config
directory.

Let's Say we have multiple versions of the same infra like dev, staging and
prod then use the same code but keep the state files seperate.

To Create WorkSpace:
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod

This is helping us to create 2 seperate workspace:
How to use Dev evironment:

terrform workspace select dev
terraform apply --var-file=dev.tfvar

(cretae bucket named- sonamsoni-dev-dev)

If you want to deploy in prod

terrform workspace select prod
terraform apply --var-file=prod.tfvar
(create bucket sonamsoni-prod-prod with this name)

The state will be maintained

.terraform
    terraform.tfstate
    envs/   
        dev/terraform.tfstate
        prod/terraform.tfstate

To run all commands to gether we can create script as well.
run.sh file and add all comands in that file.

For Also, to destroy reosources.
terrform workspace select prod
terraform destroy --var-file=prod.tfvar

Cheking worksaces:

terraform worksace list (to see all)
terraform worksace show (show the current workspace)
