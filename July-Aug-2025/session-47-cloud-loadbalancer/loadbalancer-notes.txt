Let's Create ALB - Application Load balancer

to implement the same first of all Create 2 ubuntu instances.

create instance --> AMI ubuntu --> sec group with 22 and 80 port
in vpc --> select default --> select subnets like 1b,1c
create instance.

connect both instance one by one and execute below commands
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx -y 
    cd /var/www/html
    sudo nano index.html (add some message <h1>hello from Server 1</h1>)
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    sudo systemctl start nginx

Create Target Groups ---> 
    instances --> keep all others as default and next
    then here select instances that you want to add then click on
    add pending targets below and then create target group.

Create Load balancer--> Application Load balancer
name , scheme -- internet facing, Ip -- Ipv4
vpc -- default, select availability zones in place you have created instance.

sec group- default and you instance sec group.

listener --> HTTP --> in default action select target group created.

create load balancer.

once its created you can see the DNS to handle HTTP req
when you send req you can see the response from any one of your instance
