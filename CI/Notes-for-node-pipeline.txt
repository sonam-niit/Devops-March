For node project
node must be installed in your system

create configuration file: npm init -y
(it will create package.json file)

for installing dependencies
npm i mocha --save-dev

this will install dependencies after that for executing
test commands add one script in test of your
package.json file

"test": "mocha tests/*.test.js"

(run all files under the tests folder which ends with test.js
extension)

create src folder for source code
create index.js file as main file (similar to main.py)

for test cases:
	create folder named tests
	under that create one test case file (index.test.js)

after that save all files and check it in your terminal 
by executing below command:
	npm run test

(it should show the output with 3 test cases passed successfully)
